@maureenjohnson I will show you fear in a handful of tissues. Listen, I'll be honest. I could show you fear just about anywhere.
So here's fear in a handful of dust. And, uh, here's my shelf of Xbox games. Let's see, what else? I already showed you the fear dust right?

When a door closes, a window opens. Then the cabinets rattle and the cats run away and you hear faint whispers and screams in the walls.
Price reduced! 3 BR/2 BA home with unbelievable views. You won’t believe the views. You won’t ever fully understand what you will see.
It’s not whether you win or lose, it’s how and when you die that’s written on this accidentally declassified government document.
Ask your doctor "Do the flowers bloom like this in Paris?" Then check your watch. Take the briefcase she leaves you and bring it to us.
Lost: Dog. She lived her entire life and now I don't have her anymore. Generally I'm ok with this. Not always.
Some say we eat an average of 8 spiders a year in our sleep. This is untrue. Not all arachnids are considered spiders.

If you love something, set it free. If it doesn’t come back, it probably died of sadness because it thought you loved it.
Lovers come and go, but friends are forever. Your friends are immortal. They just found out, and it’s been rough. Don’t bring it up.
If you ever find yourself feeling lost, take pride in the accuracy of your feelings.
Ask your doctor “why?” Keep asking. Do not stop asking your doctor this. Whisper “why” as you slump, sedated, into uniformed arms.

Hi New Orleans. We will see you on Mar 11. We can always see you, but it will be in person on that date: http://t.co/tiOmUYozmx
OLYMPICS UPDATE: Snow is falling somewhere. Many things are falling or will fall or have fallen. But temporary triumph is still triumph.
A man walks into a bar. The bartender does not see him. No one sees him. The man died years ago. It is cold in the bar.
OLYMPICS UPDATE: The human body is capable of amazing things. We think that is a human body. Nope. Not at all. Nevermind. Run!
"At least your heart's in the right place," I say, softly running my hand across a translucent take-out container.
Have you ever seen something you couldn't understand then didn't tell anyone because you were afraid they wouldn't believe you? Good. Good.

Imagine yourself in a brand new car. Imagine yourself with new skin, teeth, hair. Imagine a different you, living a different life. Go mad.
If you are afraid of the dark, don't be. Most of the truly frightening things are too small to be seen or inside your body already.
All that glitters is not gold. Particularly that over there. That’s maybe an insect of some sort. It’s really too dark to tell.
OLYMPICS UPDATE: A cloud dissipates and then forms into new clouds. The new clouds are not the old cloud, but also they are.
OLYMPICS FACTS: The human heart weighs 8-12 ounces and can be found right over there. Just look under the cardboard lid. Cool, right?
OLYMPICS FACTS: Outer space is very cold. Also very quiet. No one knows quite how large the void is.

If you see something, no you didn’t.
SAGITTARIUS - The upside is that there's a beautiful garden growing from you.
SCORPIO - All you need is love. &amp; a military-grade gas mask. &amp; bottled water. &amp; several months of rations. That and love is all you need.
LIBRA - Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads. (We're going to die &amp; decompose someday, so roads will be unnecessary at that point.)
VIRGO - You have been granted three wishes. I mean infinite. I mean condemned to. I mean lives. You've been condemned to infinite lives.
LEO - The coroner finally completed your autopsy. It took weeks of reconstruction, but we've learned a lot about what happened.
CANCER - Don't shoot the messenger. Shoot the microchip controlling him. It's on his temple. Aim caref-- Nope! More carefully than that.

@maureenjohnson it seems a little early for christmas carols

All the world's a stage/And all the men and women merely stagehands/And the actors are rocks and moss/And the audience is the void
We are the livestock of plants and trees, which feed us and give us air knowing that we will soon die and feed them.
Missed connections - You: a tree. Me: a tree. Neither of us said a word. We are still next to each other... immobile, silent, centuries-old.

John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt: His name is an ancient curse, and now there's a dense fog, and I felt something slither across my foot.
Parents: Talk to your kids about pyramids. Ask them what they know. This is important. Ask them!
Most omnivores won't actually eat everything. You make one simple offer and they just start screaming.
In space, no one can hear you scream. This is why we keep mp3s of your screams, which we'll listen to later, when we can truly enjoy them.
Just to be completely transparent with you, I'm going to remove this coat and these bandages. Now you cannot see me at all.
Get the hair you've always wanted. It's right here in a dripping clump, hanging from this hook. It's still warm.

There is no cause for concern. We're way past that now. If you're not at least feeling mild terror then you haven't been paying attention.
"I know you are, but what am I" I ask the sky. "I honestly don't know," I add. A single star moves slowly to prove it is just a plane.
"Congratulations!" reads the sign in your lawn. A blinking arrow is pointing to a deep hole in the earth. You feel rumbling or nothing.
"We have you surrounded." -literally everything that isn't you.
If you only see one movie this year, it will be the one you last saw. You won't be seeing any more movies this year. Best you not know why.

GEMINI: What has 4 legs in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, and 3 at night? This weird dog that needs a good home!
TAURUS: Children should be seen and not heard. It's the other way around in this dark forest, though. The GPS has stopped working, too.
ARIES: There are no dumb questions. Only dangerous ones. Watch your mouth. Watch your neighbor's mouth. Who is the rat here?
PISCES: They see you. Get out of your house. Run!
AQUARIUS: Your days are numbered. They're numbered randomly from here on out. Write everything down. Everything. Include dates.
CAPRICORN: Sorry about that argument with your friend last week. But don't worry. Everything's been "taken care of" *wink* *gnarled grin*
SAGITTARIUS: Some things are better left unsaid. They are written on limestone and buried under your home. Never look for these things.
SCORPIO: Roses are ash. Violets are ash. Ash. And some cold wind. Mostly ash.
LIBRA: Ghosts aren't real, so I have no idea what that awful noise in your walls is. How long is your lease?
VIRGO: It's not to late! It's not too early, either! Time does not exist for you. Unfortunately, you are immortal.
LEO: You take the good. You take the bad. You take them both and there you have some cookies and some tarantulas all mixed together.

In answer to the many ppl asking, we don't know where all your chairs went and are pretty sure your walls were already painted like that.
Siren means brush fires. Loud beeping means unidentified aircraft. Mournful flutes from the desert are meaningless and perfectly safe.
In the old days someone delivered ice/milk/newspapers door to door. Now he just stands on the curb staring &amp; snarling threateningly.
"Don't make me come up there," I shout to the empty night sky.
It's about time you tell your kids about the birds and bees. Then tell them about bears. Then try to explain lizards. Pace yourself.
It is better to ask for permission than to scream for forgiveness.

Help control the pet population. Have your pet merged with all the other pets into a single superpet. Superpet will then care for us.
Open your heart. Let the insects scatter in fluid patterns across your ribs. You can close your heart now, okay. Were you born in a barn?

@timescanner it is what the stars say.
"RTs are not endorsements," I explain to the baby spiders rapidly spreading across the bathroom tiles.
GEMINI: It's fine to scream at all the strange faces in the mirror. But they're just observing. They mean you little harm.
TAURUS: It's not a heartbeat. It's a filibuster, trying to prolong the status quo &amp; stave off great change.
ARIES: He sure is a happy camper. That man in the shadow's edge of the woods just grins and grins.
PISCES: Meet the man of your dreams: a capuchin with a literal organ grinder &amp; expressionless eyes that stare right into you.
AQUARIUS: When God closes a door, he opens a window. But the swarm is still getting in. Close it. Close the window!
CAPRICORN: There's no such thing as a free lunch. There's no thing. There's nothing. Not a single thing exists.
SAGITTARIUS: There's a special place in hell for people like you. They're all exactly like you in every way. Thousands of them.
SCORPIO: Money doesn't grow on trees. Your progeny do. You're a tree now. We wish we knew which one. We miss you.
LIBRA: Get into a good book. Get in there &amp; embrace your new home of ink &amp; pulp. Be forgotten on the shelf above the TV. Never return.
VIRGO: Aim for the moon. Because even if you miss, you'll still die cold and alone in a silent vacuum.
LEO: There are many organ donors. You can also register as an organ collector. You'll need some clay jars and a good marker.
CANCER: There's a bird here that claims to know you. Says you're related. The bird said this with its eyes. Birds can't talk.
@MmeSurly We have forests full of this kind of tree. (willow? cherry? elm? not sure.) w/e it is, it's in full bloom. http://t.co/zQRzN75RUB

Regret nothing. Regret the void. Regret emptiness. Regret loss. Regret words and actions not done. Regret the nothing of your past.

When you wish upon a star, it is actually a satellite and your wish is recorded in a special file. You really shouldn't do that.

Thanks everyone. We appreciate the use of your brain waves a couple times a month.
Take some time. Take a lot of time. Hoard  your time. Live in a filthy apartment with piles of time up to the ceiling.
@angelicangel360 thank you for listening!
Ask your doctor a seemingly innocent question. Tap the side of your nose. Say "Perhaps I have said too much." Say it again.
Out now: Ep 25 "One Year Later". Our big anniversary episode. Thanks for a great year. http://t.co/9bVq60SbHP
Fishing, hiking, and staring with blank terror at an empty sky. And what are your hobbies?
Ask your doctor to get away. Ask him to stand back and stop looking directly at you. Ask your doctor if he believes in the devil. Ask him.
Measure twice, cut once. Gather the remnants &amp; ask what have you done. What have you done?
@nice_mustard hey thanks n_m! That means a lot.
The answer lies within your own heart. That is why those dark-suited agents are tailing you. Tell your cab driver to step on it!
Our most valuable natural resource is our children's minds. I mean the water weight alone could bring a tidy profit.
@ZSGhost maybe! It will definitely be up by morning, but we're not always able to get it up by midnight.
@MichaelVarrati hey thanks!
@MattMcC1 @timescanner there is continuity so yes, the beginning is probably best
Tomorrow: Our one year anniversary episode. This is a big one. Get your ears ready. http://t.co/9bVq60SbHP
@timescanner well! thank you!
Finally, if you'd like to support the looming dark shape blotting out the sun, I think we're all supposed to kneel and offer blood.
Also: If you're a fan of @rachelkann's poetry, support the Indiegogo for her new book 10 FOR EVERYTHING (final day!) http://t.co/SmriWs73lt

Confused? At a loss for what to do? Wow, sounds like you're human. Good luck.
Born without permission? Do you feel physical/emotional pain? Is the universe indifferent to you? You may be entitled to compensation.
Don't get carried away. Stay hidden until it leaves town.
@caseyrosenthal actually, flies prefer the cold skin of pedants after all their beloved truths have failed them
Life is like a box of chocolates - handed to you unexpectedly by a shadowy man and filled with insects.
You'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. But you'll catch even more with a corpse of some sort.
@nomopoetry the eyes retracted so I had to rewrite it.
Part of me wants to stay in tonight and watch a movie. Part of me is growing scales. And another part of me is losing a lot of blood.
Just 2 days until our big anniversary episode, in which we celebrate our first year by killing a character you like. Sorry.
Just because when you looked in the crystal ball you saw nothing, doesn't mean it wasn't correctly showing you your future.
The faceless old woman who secretly lives in your home is drawing skulls on your dinner plates.

Pain is just a large, spiky worm-looking thing leaving your body (through the sinus)
Current weather: flecks of something
Only an edict from a vague yet menacing government agency can prevent wildfires.
If you're a solipsist, everybody is the man or woman of your dreams.
Ask your doctor if you are a tree, if we are all trees, if everything is a single being of shared roots and majestic limbs.
Help control the pet population. Stop calling ants pets. They do not love you and it's inflating the numbers.
@AceMakesWords  hey thanks!
@wonderingwest @mountennui yes
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single command from a satellite-activated mind control chip.
Big News. Wow: Night Vale creator Joseph Fink is teaching a podcasting class. Learn to write/develop/run a podcast. https://t.co/4zfJssRUya
@shessomickey @amandapalmer @mountain_goats Yes we did.
This Saturday: Our anniversary episode, in which Big Stuff Happens, as 115 people in NYC can now attest. http://t.co/9bVq60SbHP
If you dig a deep hole, you do not end up in China. But you may just look up to see strange shadowy figures with shovels, filling it in.
@amandapalmer @shessomickey the first concert we saw in NYC was you at Webster Hall, so it seemed fitting.
It's darkest before the dawn. Usually, not this dark though. Wow, this is like pitch black. Wasn't dawn supposed to be two hours ago?
@raigner sure thing! thanks for performing with us!
Parents: talk to your teens about the magical properties of different metals.
Once again, thanks for everyone who came to the party. And congratulations to everyone who got out.
@New_Mexico_News yeah! Thanks for that!
Thank you everyone who came to our anniversary party. Your family can  collect you in a few years when the project is complete.
@Linkspartner "One Year Later"
@EnnaYllek great! See you at Webster hall!

Distance makes the heart grow larger and beat faster. (DANGER: you are nearing the "Checkpoint")
@LeavittAlone general seating/standing. not like a play or anything where we close the doors at a certain time.
Once again, TONIGHT, WEBSTER HALL, 7:30. Bring your friends. Get your friends there. Kidnap your friends. https://t.co/5uAvz4AXB0
What are the stars telling us today? Ah, LONELINESS and INFINITY and AWE again. Man, they just keep repeating themselves.

If you find a lower price anywhere else, we will melt into bubbling tar as vultures circle overhead!

@thomjking hey thanks!
@airzae hey thanks so much!
You can't get blood out of a stone. But you can get blood *because* of a stone.
@nickle4urdreams you can email it to us at nightvale@commonplacebooks.com. A link to a specific song in streaming form is best.
IMPORTANT:We were able to move Night Vale party back to Webster Hall. Sorry for the confusion. And for all the blood https://t.co/vMzmXtUZkC
It just goes in one ear and out the other. It emerges squealing and writhing. It's kind of eel-looking but with more human-like teeth.
Night Vale Anniversary Party TOMORROW. Come celebrate with us. Please note new venue. https://t.co/vMzmXtUZkC
How can global warming be real if it's snowing outside and all heat in the universe will eventually dissipate into nothingness?
Make like a tree and seethe with a secret sentience and loathing for the world that you will never be able to express.
Be the crippling fear you want to see in the world.
Smile and the world smiles with you. Cry and the world smiles with you. Scream and the world smiles with you. Run and hide and the world smi

If you ask a cop if there's a god, he has to start crying.
Take a picture. It'll last slightly longer before also disappearing and being forgotten.
Only one week to Ep 25 "One Year Later", in which Stuff Happens. Or only 3 days if you come to our anniversary party. http://t.co/9bVq60SbHP
The Golden Rule: Treat others as you wish you treated others.
Please follow all signs, posted directives, premonitions, and gut feelings.
@Satyr69 ah glad to hear. thank you!
it takes heart. it takes guts. it also takes cash. it just needs payment asap.
@JDCorley thank you!
The Department of Health and Safety  issued the following statement: "Safety is an illusion. Who were we kidding?" before quietly weeping.
Since atoms are mostly empty space, you might think you could walk through walls. But you aren't made of atoms. You aren't made of anything.
If you gaze into the abyss, you'll see the new Old Navy outlet. We don't know how to get to it.
Please do not feed the birds. Don't they have enough advantages over us?
Urgent Weather Alert: There is a blinking light up on the mountain. The blinking light is red. We don't know why.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Nothing falls far from that tree. We are all drawn to that tree. It is a very familiar tree.
ONCE AGAIN: Venue changed for our Anniversary Party next week. Now at East Village Social. Blood sacrifice still on. https://t.co/vMzmXtUZkC

Text the word BLOOD to a random number to make a one-time donation*.

When the going gets tough, the tough start clutching at their eyes and screaming. (The going got pretty tough tbh)
@Satyr69 yes! Sort of! You'll see.
@takunta @MaraWritesStuff She is probably more excited for the episode after that, for top secret reasons.
"I know you are, but what am I?" I say to a tree. "but what am I?" I repeat to a cloud. "but what am I?" I say again to a deer. "but wh-
If you ask a cop if he is a cop, he is required to explain none of this *sweeping hand gesture* is anything except fleeting perception.
If you watch this videotape you will receive a phone call at some point and then die one day.
Listen to your heart. It's buzzing. You have a bee infestation. No sudden movements okay.
Save money by growing your own herbs. All you need is a host body and a prayer book.
You can always tell when a storm is coming, bc animals turn translucent and start whispering in an unknown language.
Liked our last couple weathers? Why not watch cool live versions of them or something? http://t.co/j3AnORotH6 and http://t.co/3qcXlk6e1T
It's coming. Prepare yourself. https://t.co/t5cN1daEtU
Why don't you make like a baby and require lots of love and protection because you are fragile and small?
If you love something, let it go, if it comes back, you're doomed because it's very hungry.
Don't shoot the messenger. It's boring. Think of all the possibilities that sharp edges provide alone.
Roses are dust
Violets are dust
Everything is dust
Except for the ash
If this had been an actual emergency, this announcement would be followed by the sound of howling wolves and a strong smell of olives.
Good things come to those who wait. But so do really malevolent and scary things. In fact, probably more of those. Better keep moving.
@HungryStu your question implies that you have a choice in that matter
Don't RT me if you don't exist.
@Lady_Noremon if you go to our feedburner page (http://t.co/rn47f87uza), you can right-click the titles to download mp3s directly.
@MmeSurly @rigamarock everyone dies well before the End
Behind every great man there is a powerful fear of death.
Everything in life makes sense when you realize that the entire universe functions on dream logic.
@MmeSurly the whole project gets slowed down bc the universe takes such long smoke breaks.
Action item: heat death
Assigned to: universe
Status: in progress
Why is a raven like a writing desk? (They're both filled with blood and covered in black feathers)
You will not find answers in the stars. Unless of course your question is 'what am i made of' or 'where is that screaming coming from'
The rain in Spain stays mainly in this one triangular cloud. There's a pulsing green light &amp; loud hum coming from that cloud.
REMINDER 4: That you are more sentient than a stone is a matter of perspective. Your perspective. Can you trust yourself to be objective?

And now, a series of important reminders. Hold on tight to someone you imagine you love.
Live each day as if it were your last. (struggling wildly to free yourself from an enormous spider web)
When life gives you lemons, cower and scream because they're filled with lumps of hair and teeth.
